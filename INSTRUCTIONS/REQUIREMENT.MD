I have this project I need to do for my md 
it's based on primary SCHOOL AND secondary school book, I'm to start with primary 1

for each topic there is a performance/objective, Contents, Teachers activities, Students activities, teaching and learing material, Evauation guide that comes with it from the education board curriculum 

What I want to do is generate a visually appealing, best and most interesting clear creation ever that is very explanatory, fun to read and stiaght to point with vivid clear eamples that no matter how academically poor, dull or empty brain that student is, they will understand that topic perfectly well üëå, "This is a textbook I want to push to all schools in the world and that they will love to buy cause it will be the best for every subject and topic

what i want is to create the contents for the subjects and topics, for any topic, I will provide the necessary details for that topic like:
-- performance/objective, Contents, Teachers activities, Students activities, teaching and learing material, Evauation guide

## Project Structure
The application follows a 4-level hierarchy: Classes ‚Üí Subjects ‚Üí Chapters ‚Üí Topics (e.g., Primary 1 ‚Üí Mathematics ‚Üí Number and Numeration ‚Üí Numbers 1-5).

### Content Organization:
- **All Classes**: Individual topic files organized in `/src/content/data/[class]/[subject]/[chapter]/` structure
- **Chapter-based**: Topics are grouped by curriculum chapters (e.g., "Number and Numeration", "Basic Operations")
- **Curriculum Files**: Theme-based consolidated curriculum files in `/INSTRUCTIONS/CLASSES/[CLASS]/[SUBJECT]/` for planning
- The registry in `/src/lib/content.ts` manages the hierarchical organization and navigation between classes, subjects, chapters, and topics.
- Professional 4-level sidebar navigation allows easy browsing while maintaining clean PDF generation without sidebar interference.

### File Naming Conventions:
- **Individual Topics**: `topic-name.ts` (organized by chapter in folder structure)
- **Chapter Consolidation**: `pry[X]-chapter-name.md` (for curriculum planning)
- **Table of Contents**: `pry[X]-toc-[subject].md`

## Curriculum Extraction Guidelines

### For Primary 4+ Content Structure:
When extracting curriculum from images/documents, organize content into **THEME-BASED CONSOLIDATED FILES**:

#### Theme Organization Pattern:
- **Theme 1: Number and Numeration** ‚Üí `pry[X]-number-numeration.md`
- **Theme 2: Basic Operations** ‚Üí `pry[X]-basic-operations.md`
- **Theme 3: Mensuration** ‚Üí `pry[X]-mensuration.md`

## Next Steps for New Chat:

### To Continue Primary 4 Mathematics:
1. **Review completed Number and Numeration chapter** in `/src/content/data/primary-4/mathematics/number-and-numeration/`
2. **Create Basic Operations chapter** folder: `/src/content/data/primary-4/mathematics/basic-operations/`
3. **Extract content for Basic Operations topics** from `pry4-basic-operations.md`
4. **Create TypeScript topic files** for Topics 5-12 (Addition/Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Estimation, Open Sentence)
5. **Update content registry** to include new chapter and topics
6. **Test UI and PDF generation** for new content

### Implementation Pattern:
1. Create chapter folder in `/src/content/data/[class]/[subject]/[chapter]/`
2. Create topic TypeScript file with 3 pages of content
3. Import and add to `/src/lib/content.ts` registry under appropriate chapter
4. Test in UI at `http://localhost:3000/classes/Primary%204/subjects/Mathematics/chapters/[chapter]/topics/[slug]`
5. Verify PDF generation works correctly
6. Proceed to next topic

### Content Quality Standards:
- **3 pages per topic** with distinct learning focuses
- **Professional educational content** with real-world examples
- **Structured learning blocks** (intro, practice, assessment)
- **Side-by-side activity boxes** (Teacher Activities | Student Activities)
- **Rich content types**: definitions, examples, activities, assessments

## AI Integration Roadmap:
- **Current Phase**: Content development in TypeScript
- **Future Phase 1**: Database migration (PostgreSQL + JSONB)
- **Future Phase 2**: AI integration using structured content (NOT PDFs)
- **Architecture**: Ready for seamless AI chatbot integration with contextual responses

## For New AI Assistant:
1. **Tag this file** plus `/src/lib/content.ts` for current status
2. **Review completed topics** in `/src/content/data/primary-4/mathematics/number-and-numeration/` for patterns
3. **Use curriculum files** in `/INSTRUCTIONS/CLASSES/PRIMARY-4/MATHEMATICS-04/` for content extraction
4. **Follow 4-level hierarchy**: Class ‚Üí Subject ‚Üí Chapter ‚Üí Topic
5. **Create chapter folders** before adding topics
6. **Update registry** with chapter structure: `chapters: { "Chapter Name": [topics] }`
7. **Test thoroughly** before proceeding to next topics

### Key Functions in `/src/lib/content.ts`:
- `listClasses()` - Get all classes
- `listSubjects(className)` - Get subjects for a class
- `listChapters(className, subject)` - Get chapters for a subject  
- `getAllTopicsInChapter(className, subject, chapter)` - Get topics in a chapter
- `getTopic(className, subject, chapter, slug)` - Get specific topic
